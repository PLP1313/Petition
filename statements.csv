1. I rely on the gym during evening hours due to my work schedule, making it challenging to fit in workouts with the current operating hours.
2. The promise of extended operating hours, including access to sauna and swimming pool until 22:00, influenced my decision to join the current gym.
3. Extending the swimming pool hours until 22:30 or 23:00 would better accommodate my schedule and enhance my gym experience.
4. Recent changes in operating hours, including closing the sauna, jacuzzi, swimming pool, and resting beds by 21:30, have caused inconvenience for me.
5. Staff rushing me out of the changing area by 22:00 creates discomfort and adds to the inconvenience I experience.
6. Extending the closing time of the changing areas by at least 30 minutes after the gym's official closing time would alleviate my rushed experiences.
7. I find that using the gym until closing time at 23:00 leaves me lacking access to shower facilities, impacting my post-workout routines and hygiene.
